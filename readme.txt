**Module Labels üè∑Ô∏è**
- Shows module names on frontend for easy identification
- Works with ACF flexible content modules (default)
- Supports custom theme modules via configuration
- Configurable per theme - no plugin modifications needed
- Keyboard shortcut: Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + M

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `gm-dev-tools` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Navigate to Tools ‚Üí G&M Dev Tools to configure settings
4. Enable/disable individual tools as needed

== Module Labels Configuration ==

The Module Labels tool can be customized for any theme without modifying the plugin.

= Default Behavior =
By default, looks for ACF modules with `data-acf-module` attributes.

= Custom Configuration =
Add a configuration file to your theme root: `gm-dev-tools-config.php`

Example configuration:
```php
<?php
return array(
    'module_labels' => array(
        'selector' => '[data-module]',
        'attribute' => 'module',
        'format_prefix' => 'page_module_',
    )
);
```

This allows the plugin to work with any module naming convention.

== Usage ==

= Admin Settings =
1. Go to Tools ‚Üí G&M Dev Tools in your WordPress admin
2. Check the boxes next to the tools you want to enable
3. Click "Save Changes"

= Frontend Tools =
1. Visit your website's frontend
2. Look for the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) in the bottom-right corner
3. Click to expand the tool panel
4. Click individual tool buttons to activate/deactivate them

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do these tools affect my live site? =
The tools are only visible to logged-in administrators and do not affect regular site visitors.

= Can I use this with any theme? =
Yes! G&M Dev Tools works with any WordPress theme.

= How do I make Module Labels work with my custom modules? =
Add a `gm-dev-tools-config.php` file to your theme with your module selector configuration. See the Module Labels Configuration section for details.
