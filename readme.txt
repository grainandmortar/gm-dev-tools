== Development ==

This plugin uses a modular architecture where each tool is self-contained. To add a new tool:

1. Create a new folder in `/tools/your-tool-name/`
2. Create a class file extending `GM_Dev_Tool`
3. Register your tool in the main plugin file
4. Add any assets (CSS/JS) in the tool's assets folder

* These tools are for development only
* Remember to disable all tools before deploying to production
* Tools are only visible on the frontend when enabled
* Some tools use localStorage to persist their state
